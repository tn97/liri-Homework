# liri-Homework
Liri is a basic-command bot, modelled after Siri, Apple's AI.
This basic AI can do small things like find when and where a band of the user's choice will be playing, get information about music, and even information about movies.

What makes Liri different is that it (he/she?) runs from the command line.
